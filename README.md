My name is Marissa Bush and I'm a data scientist with a background in English teaching education and a recent graduate of Flatiron School. I have experience teaching English both abroad and online. Through teaching, I've developed strong problem-solving and communication skills that I believe are valuable in data science.

I became a data scientist because I'm passionate about using data and science-backed analysis to solve problems and create positive impact. By leveraging my skills in data analysis and visualization, I hope to make meaningful contributions to projects that make a difference in people's lives.
